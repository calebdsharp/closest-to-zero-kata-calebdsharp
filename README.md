# Kata Time: Take 2
## Closest to Zero Kata

### The Challenge
Test-drive a method to accept a list of integers and return the one that is closest to zero.

If two different numbers tie for distance from zero (for example, 2 and -2), always return the positive one.

As with the prior assignment, we'll get you started with the first unit test and a stubbed method to pass the first test.

### Stretch Tasks
The method should `throw` an error if the list is empty.
